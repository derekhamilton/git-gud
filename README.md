# git-gud

Improving the Git CLI experience with fzf

## What is this?

Rather than needing to remember the exact name of the branch, tag or remote, or the exact syntax of the different git commands needed, **git-gud** will provide a list to choose from.

By using `fzf` for these lists, finding and choosing which item can be done by fuzzy searching the text.

And unlike the git GUIs out there, **git-gud** will say exactly what it's doing by displaying the command it will run before the selection is made.

## Requirements

[git](https://github.com/git/git) and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) must be installed.

## Installation

To automatically configure, run

```
sudo ./install.sh
```

which will symlink the commands to `/usr/local/bin`

An uninstall script is also provided to remove the symlinks

```
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

To install manually, add the project directory to `$PATH`

With or without the install script, to use the command aliases, the following definitions need to be added to `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` or whichever configuration file is appropriate for the Unix shell being used.

```
alias gg="gg-menu"
alias ggc="gg-checkout-branch"
alias ggcr="gg-checkout-branch-remote"
alias ggct="gg-checkout-tag"
alias ggbt="gg-branch-tag"
alias ggm="gg-merge-branch"
alias ggmt="gg-merge-tag"
alias ggms="gg-merge-squash"
alias ggup="gg-upstream-push"
alias ggpt="gg-push-tag"
alias ggd="gg-delete-branch"
alias ggdf="gg-delete-branch-force"
alias ggdt="gg-delete-tag"
alias ggdtr="gg-delete-tag-remote"
```

## Usage

**gid-gud** is run from the command line, same as `git`. The commands will be standard git commands, as if running them directly in the current working directory.

### Menu

The `gg-menu` command (alias `gg`) will bring up a fzf list of all the commands that git-gud provides, as well as additional standard git commands.

Custom commands can be added to menu by creating `~/.gg-options` with the options listed in it, one per line, with the command and description separated by `|`.

Note: Commands cannot contain 2 consecutive spaces (`git log`: good, `git  log`: bad). The options are formatted using `column` and the two spaces are how the command column is delimited.

```
git dosomething      | Description of my command
git dosomethingelse  | Description of my other command
```

### Individual commands

There are several commands added to make use of `fzf` and make interacting with basic git commands faster and easier.

Commands will list out the available branches or tags in `fzf` as a fuzzy searchable menu rather than requiring that they be provided up front.
